# SGCipher
Hello and welcome to SGCipher!

Most of the information you need to actually run the program can be found by launching the application. Some extra context is below:
First, this program is designed for use with the operational board game SFB PQ-17, whose rules are included in the main directory. In the game, movement on the operational hex map is handled using double-blind movement text files, where every task force corresponds to a line entry.
The code which can automate the actual on-map movement may be uploaded in a later installment.
And second, the codenames used in the program are stored as comma-separated entries in a file in src/media. If you wish to substitute them with names of your own, you can freely do so. Simply replace the text file with another one of the same name.

To use, simply download the zip and run SGCipher.exe.

Enjoy!
